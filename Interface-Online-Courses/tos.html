                    will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials,

                website, your information is protected both online and offline.


                <p>
                    Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted
                    and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address
                    bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.


                </p>
                <p>
                    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your
                    information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.


                </p>
                <p>
