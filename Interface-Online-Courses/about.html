                <h3>Our story</h3>
                <a href="https://interfaceschool.com">Interface Web School</a> is located in Omaha, Nebraska, and has been teaching
                web technology courses live and in-person since 2014. As a startup, we
                were free to develop our personal style of instruction that emphasizes
                the practical topics and experiences to help foster a deeper understanding
                of tech that goes beyond just the syntax.
                <p>
                    In 2017 Interface was acquired by the AIM Institute. AIM's mission is to grow, connect and inspire
                    the tech talent community through educational and career development initiatives.
                    Our focus is to get people excited about technology, and inspire them to pursue a tech career -
                    which leads to a better work force and ultimately allows communities to thrive.

                <h3>Our staff</h3>
                Interface instructors are developers themselves with in-depth experience in the
                technologies they teach. Our senior instructor and curriculum author Kent Smotherman
                has been a professional developer in over a dozen different computer languages througout
                a career spanning nearly 40 years. And most importantly, everyone at Interface has
                an infectious passion for tech and teaching it.
                <p>
                    Our career placement specialists assist local students with brushing up their resumes
                    and connecting with area employers. Just because class is over doesn't mean you're done!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we like to say, if you don't give up on learning, we won't give up on teaching!
